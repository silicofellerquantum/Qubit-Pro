drc/ — Advanced multi-domain DRC engine for Quantum Studio V2.

Modules
-------
geometry_drc      — metal overlap, CPW overlap, resonator/coupler collision
frequency_drc     — qubit collision, readout overlap, Purcell risk
fabrication_drc   — min width, min spacing, min bend radius
connectivity_drc  — disconnected qubit, missing resonator, broken feedline

Usage
-----
